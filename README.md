This project grew out of my attempt to write a new parser for a 1980s text
adventure game called Crystal Caverns. After finishing that project, I
reused the code to port Zork I, the game that inspired it, to C.

It is about 98% complete, but is playable from beginning to end. It is
missing some things: oops, again, the be-more-specific
prompt, and some other little things.

This source code is provided for personal, educational use only.
You are welcome to use this source code to develop your own works,
but the story-related content belongs to the original authors of Zork.

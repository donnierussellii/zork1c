>Port Zork to C
You can't see any compiler here!

This project grew out of my attempt to write a new parser for a 1980s text
adventure game called Crystal Caverns. After finishing that project, I
reused the code to port Zork I, the game that inspired it, to C.

It is about 95% complete, but is playable from beginning to end. It is
missing some things: throwing, talking, oops, again, the be-more-specific
prompt, and many other little things.
